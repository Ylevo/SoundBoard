# SoundBoard

Winforms project started in 2014. Basically it creates soundfiles hotkeys. Uses NAudio and SoundTouch.

Features :

- Control hotkeys (play/pause, stop, forward/backward, volume,  looping, master hotkey, hold down key).
- Speed/Tempo/Pitch alteration on the fly.
- Sound fading in/out distinctly for the different control actions.
- Hotkeys export in XML while supporting the different keyboard layouts and translating the keys to the importer's language.
- Export as .zip with all the soundfiles.
- Multiple files on the same hotkey with an option for the playing order (shuffle/random/default).
- Audio output setting (best used with Virtual Audio Cable or the likes of).

Only supports .mp3 and .wav unfortunately.
